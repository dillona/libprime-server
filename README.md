What is this?
-------------

Packaging for debian (ubuntu really) was a mystery to me until @sneetsher helped me to figure it out. Check out `build.sh` to see how we are now packing prime_server into its library, devel and bin packages. It also has links and notes about how to get those packages onto your PPA. Enjoy and thanks again @sneetsher!
